Analysis of Algorithm
---------------------

The analysis of algorithm is the theoretical study of computer program performance  
and resource usage.  

What's more important than performance?

### Problem: Sorting ###

Input: sequence $<a_1, a_2, a_3, ... a_n>$ of
Output: 


$$ y = x_i^{a_1^2} $$
$$ y = x^2 \; \mbox{(二次函数)} $$
