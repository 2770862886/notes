## Main Types ##

* Sequences
  suitable to linear processes, enabling you to smoothly go from on activity to another, without cluttering 
  your project.

* Flowcharts
  suitable to a more complex business logic, enabling you to integrate decisions and connect activities in a more
  diverse manner, through multiple branching logic operators.

* State Machine
  suitable for very large projects. They use a finite number of states in their execution which are triggered by
  a condition or activity.
